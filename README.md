# COVID-19-Induced-Pneumonia-Detector

## Objectives:

* Use of X-ray datasets, Pneumonia stages Dataset, and COVID X-ray datasets.

* The proposed AI technique-based workflow will allow us to analyze the patient’s condition using x-rays by spending minimal time of radiologists and patient’s money with timely actions.

* This solution is much required for countries where the population size is huge.
